This is a tamper monkey script that modifies YouTube and YouTube Music to use exponential volume instead of linear.<br/>
This enables finer grain control of low volumes and makes the minimum volume quieter without limiting the maximum volume.<br/>
This script also takes into account the volume normalization on YouTube which through off the adjustment in other scripts.<br/>

Based on a script by Marco Pfeiffer <git@marco.zone><br/>
