This is a tamper monkey script that modifies YouTube and YouTube Music to use exponential volume instead of linear. 
This enables finer grain control of low volumes and makes the minimum volume quieter without limiting the maximum volume.
This script also takes into account the volume normalization on YouTube which through off the adjustment in other scripts.

Based on a script by Marco Pfeiffer <git@marco.zone>
